# syntax-morphology-tree-gen
Project for creating a tree diagram generator tailored for syntax and morphology tree creations, focusing on the ease of creating and manipulating tree structures.

The export feature allows users to visually create trees, before exporting them as labelled bracket notations for further linguistic analysis.

The import feature further allows users to import labelled bracket notations, converting them into visual tree structures that are more easily modified.

Inspired by the [Mshang tree generator](https://mshang.ca/syntree/) used in linguistics class.
